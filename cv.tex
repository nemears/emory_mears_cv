    \large \textbf{Software Systems Engineer} \normalsize \textit{MITRE, 202 Burlington Rd, Bedford MA \hfill October 2019 - Current}

    \> Intermediate level software engineer for the Emerging Systems Engineering Technologies department at MITRE. Primary responsibility 
    is leading the software engineering on two projects at a time, coming up with the general design and assigning tasking to a small team
    of around three including myself on each project. Software deals with simulation environments, as well as visual modeling tools such as 
    UML and SysML based applications (MagicDraw, IBM Rhapsody etc.).

    \large \textbf{Simulation Tool for Aircraft System Testbed} \normalsize \textit{Mitre \hfill January 2021 - current}

    \> Working with a small team on hosting a system that runs a high fidelity real time 
    simulation written in C++. Its purpose is to aide in developing an adapter, for the aircraft being simulated, between an open
    message interface and the aircraft's message set. This enables hardware in the loop testing before deployment.\\
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{} \\

    \large \textbf{Simulation Language Static Analysis Tool} \normalsize \textit{Mitre \hfill November 2020 - October 2021}  

    \> Lead developer for a tool that linked the syntax of physics simulation engine to a UML diagramming tool, Magicdraw. 
    The physics simulation tool had its own syntax and filetype, therefore the task took the engines syntax and mapped it 
    to visual diagrams within the UML tool and used those diagrams edited or not in the tool to export back out to functional code. \\
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{} \\

    \large \textbf{Open Source UML C++ Interface} \normalsize \textit{Personal project \hfill June 2020 - current}  

    \> An attempt to provide a C++ interface to UML that is fast, lightweight and can also integrate with current tools. It was written 
    to solve a problem and to improve my own modern C++ programming skills. Fun project that is maturing and can hopefully make a 
    difference in the Systems Engineering industry. Source code: \url{https://github.com/nemears/uml-cpp} \\
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{} \\

    \large \textbf{Model Filtering Tool} \normalsize \textit{Mitre \hfill December 2021 - current}  

    \> Leading a small team in developing and maintaining a set of filters written in java for the SysML MagicDraw environment. Software relies on 
    graph and set theory to apply user supplied filters from a user interface to the SysML model. The software is deployed onto classified 
    infrastructure, and was developed for a complex data set that the Air Force had to deal with.\\
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{} \\

    \large \textbf{VSCode Modeling Extension and Website} \normalsize \textit{Personal Project \hfill June 2022 - current}  

    \> Writing mostly typescript and javascript code for a frontend for a server created in the UML C++ Interface. Code interacts with server through 
    tcp sockets, the VSCode api, and a javascript diagramming library (diagram-js). Hope is to have it be a free modeling environement unlike current 
    options. Source code: \url{https://github.com/nemears/open-uml} \\

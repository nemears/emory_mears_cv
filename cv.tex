    %MITRE
    \large \textbf{Software Systems Engineer} \normalsize \textit{MITRE, 202 Burlington Rd, Bedford MA \hfill October 2019 - Current}

    \> Software Systems Engineer for the Emerging Systems Engineering Technologies department at MITRE. The following is the 
    description of the projects and tasks that she completed, most recent to least:\\ 

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
      % \setlength\itemsep{0em}
      \item A C++ model of a system to be used for testing, mostly working on the routing of data throughout it so it could 
      integrate well with different open protocols and standards.
      \item A set of tools used for identifying important connections in graph models in MagicDraw of computer networks populated from SQL 
      databases and Kafka brokers.
      \item Integrating a simulation environment with the modeling tool MagicDraw, this involved 
      a set of static analysis tools that looked at the Abstract Syntax Tree of the simulation's code and populating diagrams and 
      tables within the modeling software.
      \item A tool using proxmox the virtualization manager to spin up qemu virtual machines and 
      set up a network based on configuration files supplied. The program would then run MITRE's caldera ("red team" hacker simulator) on 
      the virtualized network and machines.
    \end{itemize}\\

    % uml.cafe
    \large \textbf{uml.cafe} \normalsize \textit{Independent, \hfill June 2021 - Current}

    \> \href{https://uml.cafe}{uml.cafe} is the domain name of a live, multi-user, UML diagramming web application made completely 
    by Emory. It is compromised of 4 different code repositories that she worked on in her free time after work. The four parts are: 
    The simple and quick \href{https://github.com/nemears/uml-cpp}{uml-cpp} which manages the core of the uml operations on the backend
    per user. \href{https://github.com/nemears/uml-user-service}{uml-user-service} is a websocket server written in Rust used as a layer to
    handle user level interactions and serves as the website api endpoint. \href{https://github.com/nemears/uml-js}{uml-js} is the 
    JavaScript library that serves as the api to interact with the backend / endpoint of the server. \href{https://github.com/nemears/uml-cafe}{uml-cafe}
    is the Vue frontend app that makes up the visuals of \href{https://uml.cafe}{uml.cafe}. Please feel free to play around with it if you have time.\\

    % MQP
    \large \textbf{Thermodynamics Research} \normalsize \textit{WPI, 100 Institute rd, Worcester MA \hfill June 2018 - June 2019}

    \> While working on the WPI senior year capstone project she was able to work in a lab and assisted with some image analysis 
    algorithms written in python that were used and eventually cited in a \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06002.pdf}{publication in Nature}
    to validate some non-equilibrium thermodynamics theory a staff member was working on.

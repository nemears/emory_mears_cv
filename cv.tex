% preamble
Em is a skilled Software Engineer with 5 years of experience in modern C++ programming, as well as 2 years of Fullstack web development experience. 
Most recently she lead development of a web based custom modeling tool built with multithreaded C++ that hosts users' project data in the cloud! 
Em is an innovative and efficient engineer with a passion for creating fast, efficient and clever solutions, while learning as much as she can.

     \> Uml Cafe is a live, realtime multi-user, UML diagramming platform hosted on the web whose development was led 
     by Em. She developed the protocol, datastructures and API's used to interact with a UML project, and built the platform up from there. She wrote the
     entire Rust and C++ multithreaded backend, and lead a small team of two in creating the frontend client. The platform is hosted live on 
     \url{https://uml.cafe} with a concise demo video on the welcome screen. She maintains the server and provides regular updates.\\

    %MITRE
    \large \textbf{Software Systems Engineer} \normalsize \textit{MITRE, 202 Burlington Rd, Bedford MA \hfill October 2019 - Nov 2023}

    \> Software Systems Engineer for the Emerging Systems Engineering Technologies department at MITRE. The following is the 
    description of the projects and tasks that she completed, most recent to least:\\ 

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
      \item Lead a team in expanding a C++ multithreaded model of a system to be used for testing, she worked on the data structures and interfaces it consumed so it could 
      integrate well with different industry protocols. The model ran as a distributed system that could be organized via Docker sending data to cloud storage.
      \item Led a team in developing a set of tools in Java used for identifying important connections in graph models of computer networks populated from SQL 
      databases and cloud storage via Kafka brokers.
      \item Integrated a simulation environment with a modeling tool. This included breaking the simulation down into Java data structures, and eventually breaking the
      data in the modeling tool back into Python data structures and runnable code to re-execute the simulation, now integrated with the modeling tool.
      \item A tool using proxmox the virtualization manager and Ansible to spin up qemu virtual machines in order to set up a network with PLC(s) running FreeRTOS.
      The program would then run MITRE's caldera ("red team" AI) built for real time operating systems to test the sytem against cybersecurity threats.

    \> While working on the WPI senior year capstone project she was able to work in a lab and assisted with some image analysis 
    algorithms written in python that were used and eventually cited in a \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06002.pdf}{publication in Nature}
    to validate some non-equilibrium thermodynamics theory a staff member was working on.

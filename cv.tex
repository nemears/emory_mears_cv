    %MITRE
    \large \textbf{Software Systems Engineer at MITRE} \normalsize \textit{MITRE, 202 Burlington Rd, Bedford MA \hfill October 2019 - Current}

    \> Software Systems Engineer for the Emerging Systems Engineering Technologies department at MITRE. MITRE assigns staff to work 
    on two seperate projects at a time, so resonsibilities and tasking varied based on what what was assigned. The following is the 
    description of the projects and tasks that she completed, most recent to least. Most recently she worked on C++ model of a system
    to be used for testing, mostly working on the routing of data throughout it so it could integrate well. She also worked on a set
    of tools used for identifying important connections in models of networks. Another effort she worked on was integrating a 
    simulation environment with the modeling tool MagicDraw, this involved a set of static analysis tools that looked at the 
    Abstract Syntax Tree of the simulation's code and populating diagrams and tables within the modeling software. The first project
    she did at MITRE was a tool using proxmox the virtualization manager to spin up qemu virtual machines and set up a network based 
    on configuration files supplied. The program would then run MITRE's caldera ("red team" hacker bot) on the virtualized network and
    machines.\\

    % uml.cafe
    \large \textbf{uml.cafe} \normalsize \textit{Independent, June 2021 - Current}

    \> \href{https://uml.cafe}{uml.cafe} is the domain name of a live, multi-user, UML diagramming web application made completely 
    by Emory. It is compromised of 4 different code repositories that she worked on in her free time after work. The four parts are: 
    The simple and quick \href{https://github.com/nemears/uml-cpp}{uml-cpp} which manages the core of the uml operations on the backend
    per user. \href{https://github.com/nemears/uml-user-service}{uml-user-service} is a websocket server written in Rust used as a layer to
    handle user level interactions and serves as the website api endpoint. \href{https://github.com/nemears/uml-js}{uml-js} is the 
    Javascript library that serves as the api to interact with the backend / endpoint of the server. \href{https://github.com/open-uml2}{open-uml2}
    is the Vue frontend app that makes up the visuals of \href{https://uml.cafe}{uml.cafe}. Play around with it if you have time.\\

    % MQP
    \large \textbf{Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics Research} \normalsize \textit{WPI, June 2018 - June 2019}

    \> While working on the WPI senior year MQP capstone she was able to work in a lab and assisted with some image analysis 
    algorithms written in python that were used and eventually cited in a \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06002.pdf}{publication in Nature}.
